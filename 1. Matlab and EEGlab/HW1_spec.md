# Matlab and EEGlab tutorial (Homework 1)

During our training, you are required to complete four assignments related to MATLAB and EEGLAB. The details of these assignments are as follows:

## Assignment 1: Reading and Writing Files in MATLAB

In this assignment, you will demonstrate your skills in reading from and writing to files using MATLAB. This should include examples of opening a file, reading data from it, manipulating that data, and then writing the result back to a file.

## Assignment 2: MATLAB Arithmetic and Type Conversion

For the second assignment, you'll need to demonstrate your understanding of basic arithmetic operations and type conversion in MATLAB. You should include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, as well as examples of converting between different data types.

## Assignment 3: Plotting with Subplots and Tiledlayout in MATLAB

This assignment requires you to create several types of plots using [`subplot`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/subplot.html) and [`tiledlayout`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/tiledlayout.html) in MATLAB. Your submission should include:

- Line graphs
- Scatter plots
- Bar graphs
- Box plots

## Assignment 4: EEG Data Preprocessing with EEGLAB

Your final assignment involves performing preprocessing on EEG data using EEGLAB. The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. Your preprocessing steps should include:

- Filtering
- Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR)
- Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
- Event-related potential (ERP) analysis

**_NOTE:_**  You can see the [tutorials](https://eeglab.org/tutorials/) from the EEGlab official site.

Remember to fork the assignments from our GitHub repository, and upon completion, upload them to your personal GitHub account. We look forward to seeing your solutions!
