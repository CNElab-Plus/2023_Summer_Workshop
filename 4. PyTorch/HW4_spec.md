# Advance Pytorch tutorial (Homework 4)

## Assignment 1: Building an EEG Signal Reconstruction Model
### Task:
Develop a Deep Learning model using PyTorch that takes distorted EEG signals as input and reconstructs the original clean EEG signals. Your task involves preprocessing the data, designing the model, training it, and evaluating its performance.

### Guidance:
EEG signal reconstruction is a critical task in neuroscience and medical applications. This assignment invites you to engage in a real-world problem using the tools and techniques of deep learning. Consider the following:

* Start by understanding the nature of EEG signals, their importance, and common sources of distortion.
You may experiment with various neural network architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
* Think about the loss function that will best capture the quality of reconstruction.
*Ensure that you split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model properly.
*Reflect on how this work might be translated into real-world medical applications, and how it could make a positive impact on patient care and diagnosis.

## Assignment 2: Analyzing the Influence of Noise on Reconstruction
### Task:
Expand on your model from Assignment 1 by systematically introducing different types and levels of noise into the EEG signals. Analyze how these noises affect the reconstruction quality, and propose methods within your PyTorch model to mitigate these effects.

Guidance:
Noise in EEG signals can come from various sources and understanding its influence is essential for real-world applications. This assignment challenges you to dive deeper into the problem and think critically about robust solutions. Consider the following:

* Simulate different types of noise that might occur in real-world EEG data, such as Gaussian noise or artifacts from muscle movements.
* Explore how the noise level and type affect the reconstruction error and identify the most challenging scenarios.
* Consider implementing noise reduction techniques within your model or preprocessing pipeline.
* Reflect on how these analyses would translate into real-world scenarios and how understanding the noise can lead to more robust and reliable systems.

## Final Remarks:
By engaging with these assignments, you are not just learning how to use PyTorch, but you are also contributing to a field that has direct implications for human health and well-being. EEG signal reconstruction is an exciting intersection of technology, medicine, and neuroscience. These tasks will challenge you to think creatively and apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems. Embrace the complexity and remember that every insight you gain here could be a stepping stone to innovative solutions in healthcare and research. Enjoy the journey, and never hesitate to reach out for guidance and collaboration!
