+ Before this training, you will be required to completeat least three of the following four assignments:

  1. **Foundational** matlab and EEGlab coding
  2. **Foundational** Machine Learning Implement by Python
  3. **Advance** EEGlab data processing
  4. **Advance** Deep learning with PyTorch

Please note that all these assignments need to be forked from our GitHub repository and uploaded to your personal GitHub account upon completion.

## Instructions on How to Fork and Upload to GitHub

1. Go to our lab's GitHub repository. (Include the link here)
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.
3. Once you've forked the repository, clone it to your local machine. Use the command `git clone https://github.com/CNElab-Plus/2023_Summer_Workshop.git`.
4. After completing your assignment, push your work back up to your GitHub account with the commands `git add .`, `git commit -m "your message"`, and `git push origin master`.
