# Advance EEGlab tutorial (Homework 3)

In this set of assignments, you will be working with EEG data using EEGLAB. These tasks will require a deeper understanding of EEG analysis and the application of advanced techniques. The details of the assignments are as follows:

## Assignment 1: Comparing ERP Signal Denoising Techniques

For this assignment, you will need to apply and compare different techniques for denoising Event-Related Potential (ERP) signals. Your task is to evaluate the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for each method and discuss the results. 

Consider the following points in your report:

- Description and rationale for each denoising method used
- Comparison of the SNR obtained from each method
- Discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of each method
- Conclusion on the best method for ERP denoising based on your results

## Assignment 2: Time Frequency Analysis and ERSP Plotting

In the second assignment, you are required to perform time-frequency analysis on the denoised signals. After the analysis, you need to plot the Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) figures.

Your submission should include:

- Detailed steps of the time-frequency analysis process
- ERSP plots with proper labels and titles
- Interpretation and discussion of the ERSP results
