# Machine Learning with Python (Homework 2)

In these Homework, you will be applying various machine learning algorithms in Python using popular libraries such as scikit-learn. The details of these assignments are as follows:

## Assignment 1: Linear Regression

Predict house prices using a linear regression model. You are provided with a dataset that includes various house features and prices. Train a linear regression model on this data and use it to predict the price of a new house.

## Assignment 2: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Apply LDA for classification of handwritten digit images. Given a dataset of handwritten digit images with corresponding labels, use LDA for feature extraction and classification.

## Assignment 3: Decision Tree

Use a decision tree to classify the Iris dataset. Using the decision tree classifier in scikit-learn, categorize the Iris dataset into different classes based on flower characteristics.

## Assignment 4: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Classify handwritten digit images using SVM. Given a dataset of handwritten digit images and corresponding labels, classify the images using an SVM classifier.

## Assignment 5: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Use the KNN classifier to categorize the Iris dataset. Using the KNN classifier in scikit-learn, classify the Iris dataset into different categories based on flower features.

## Assignment 6: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization of digit images. Given a dataset of digit images, use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the images and visualize the result.

## Assignment 7: Common Spatial Patterns (CSP)

Apply the CSP algorithm for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) classification of Electroencephalography (EEG) data. Given a dataset of EEG data with corresponding class labels, use the CSP for feature extraction and classification.

## Assignment 8: DBSCAN

Apply the DBSCAN algorithm for clustering a dataset. Given a two-dimensional dataset, use the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster the data points into different groups.

## Assignment 9: k-fold Cross-Validation

Use k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of a classification model. Using the cross-validation functions in scikit-learn, perform k-fold cross-validation on a classifier and compute the average accuracy.

## Assignment 10: Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation

Evaluate the performance of a classification model using the Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation method. Given a dataset with multiple subjects, apply the Leave-One-Subject-Out validation method for performance evaluation of a classifier.
